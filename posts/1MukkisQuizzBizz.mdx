description: "Rumours are circulating that GeldBargeld had been cursed long ago, destined to protect the Danube but also to challenge those who live by it. To keep the river calm and prevent its waters from rising in a destructive flood, someone has to answer his questions correctly once a year. The questions were always different, always perplexing, and only the wisest could hope to succeed."
